Our initial analysis explored the breakdown of fatal shootings by race, gender, and age group, revealing several key trends. For instance, the data shows that White, non-Hispanic and Black, non-Hispanic individuals make up the largest groups affected by fatal police shootings. However, we’re questioning whether these numbers truly represent trends or are a result of data availability bias. To clarify, we plan to examine these racial breakdowns as proportions to see if disparities exist beyond the raw numbers. In terms of gender, our data indicates a significant imbalance, with males overwhelmingly represented among the victims. While this disparity is notable on its own, we’re also interested in exploring intersections with other factors, such as age or race, to see if these intersections provide additional insight into gender-based trends. For age, the most affected groups fall between 31-40, followed by 21-30 and 41-50, which may reflect broader demographic patterns or unique dynamics within police interactions. We’ll examine how age intersects with other variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding. When examining the data, we see that there is an overwhelming number of police shootings involving White and male victims. If we take a closer look (Figure 1), we notice that the proportion of males and females who are shot varies based on race . This means that there are trends across races where we see women make up a larger, albeit still tiny, proportion of those shot.

For Figure 2 in this week’s analysis, we included a bar chart illustrating the number of fatal shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group’s proportion of the U.S. population. This will help identify potential over-representation and give a clearer picture of any disparities. The bar chart illustrating the number of fatal police shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group's proportion of the U.S. population indicates that Black individuals have the highest proportion of fatal shootings when adjusted for population size, highlighting a critical area of concern. Conversely, the adjusted figures show that White individuals now represent one of the lowest proportions among the groups analyzed, a stark contrast to previous findings. This adjustment underscores the importance of considering population proportions when analyzing fatal police shootings, as it significantly alters the interpretation of racial disparities and calls for a deeper investigation into the underlying factors contributing to these trends. 

Figure 3 presents the results of the logistic regression model, which examines the relationship between signs of mental illness and the manner of death (e.g., "shot" vs. "shot and Tasered"). The analysis suggests that individuals with mental illness may be more likely to be shot rather than shot and Tasered, implying that police officers may use less force (such as a Taser) when they do not perceive a significant mental health crisis or threat. Conversely, the majority of cases involving "shot and Tasered" appear to involve individuals without identifiable signs of mental illness. This trend raises important questions about how mental illness status might influence police decision-making in high-stress situations, potentially reflecting a differential response based on perceived threat levels. The findings underscore the need for further investigation into how mental health awareness and training for law enforcement could impact outcomes in such encounters.
