<span style="font-size: 24px;">**The Big Question:**</span>

**Thesis: States with higher populations of people of color experience more fatal police shootings.**

This analysis examines the relationship between state demographics and fatal police shootings, exploring whether states with higher proportions of people of color also report higher rates of police violence. By focusing on state-level data, we aim to uncover patterns that may reflect systemic issues in policing.

**Why should you care?**

Understanding the correlation between race and police shootings is crucial to driving meaningful change. Engaging with this project helps spark important conversations about race, justice, and equality in America.

### How You Can Explore the Data:

This interactive visual contains 2 maps, the first of which displays darker colors for states with higher proportions of people of color, while the second shows the number of fatal shootings per 100,000 residents. Clicking on states in the left graph will pull up a racial breakdown of that given state with a unique POC entry, allowing us to see individual racial groups as well as a statistic about the colored population as a whole in the state. Hovering over states in the right-most map will display the given state name and the number of shootings adjusted for population size to offer a clearer comparison. Having these two maps side-by-side gives insight into how states and areas with larger proportions of POC see more fatal police shootings.

### What the Interactive Maps Show:

- **States with higher populations of people of color tend to have higher rates of fatal police shootings**, such as New Mexico, where 63.21% of the population is people of color and the fatal shooting rate is 5.08 per 100,000.
- **Specific racial groups, like Black and Hispanic populations, are more vulnerable to fatal shootings.** Louisiana, with a large Black population (55.05%), has a relatively high rate of fatal shootings (2.36 per 100,000).
- **Smaller POC populations**, such as in New Hampshire (92.31% White), tend to have lower rates of fatal police shootings (0.98 per 100,000).

### A Deeper Look:

We’ve created two charts to break down fatal police shootings by race. The first shows the raw data, or the total number of fatalities by race. The second adjusts those numbers to account for the population size of each group. This helps us compare how different racial groups are affected by police violence, regardless of their population size.

### Raw Data Comparison:

The **raw data** simply counts the total number of fatal police shootings for each racial group. While this helps us understand the overall scale of police violence, it doesn’t account for the fact that some racial groups are larger than others in the U.S. population.

**Raw fatalities (from most to least):**

- **White**: The highest total number of fatalities, reflecting the larger population of White Americans.
- **Black**: The second-highest total, despite Black Americans representing a smaller portion of the population.
- **Hispanic**: Fewer fatalities than White or Black groups, but still a significant number.
- **Other, Native American, Asian**: These groups experience fewer fatalities, but still face notable police violence.

While raw data shows the total number of fatalities, it doesn't give us a fair comparison of police violence between groups, as larger populations will naturally have more fatalities.

### Adjusted Data Comparison:

The **adjusted data** takes population size into account, showing the **rate** of fatal police shootings per person in each racial group. This adjustment gives a clearer picture of how disproportionately each group is affected by fatal shootings.

**Adjusted fatal shootings (from most to least affected):**

- **Black:**  Black communities have the highest rate of fatal police shootings, showing that they are disproportionately affected by police violence.
- **Other:** Multiracial and other non-Hispanic people of color also experience a higher rate of police violence compared to their population size.
- **Native American:** Native American communities also have a high rate, showing their vulnerability to police violence.
- **Hispanic:** While lower than Black and Other groups, Hispanic communities still experience a notable rate of fatal shootings.
- **White:** White communities have a low rate of fatal police shootings, indicating that police violence is less common in predominantly White areas.
- **Asian:** Asian communities have the lowest rate, meaning they are the least affected relative to their population size.

### Why the Difference?

The main difference between the **raw data** and **adjusted data** is that the **raw data** shows the total number of fatalities, which can be influenced by the size of each group. Larger groups, like White Americans, naturally have more fatalities because they make up a larger portion of the population. However, this doesn't tell us how frequently different groups experience fatal police shootings.

In contrast, the **adjusted data** accounts for population size, showing the rate of fatal police shootings for each group. This adjustment reveals that **Black communities** experience fatal shootings at a much higher rate compared to their population size, which isn’t apparent in the raw data.

By comparing the **raw data** (total fatalities) with the **adjusted data** (rates), we get a fuller understanding of the issue. The raw data shows the overall scale of police violence, while the adjusted data reveals the disproportionate impact on smaller, marginalized communities—especially Black Americans. This distinction is crucial for understanding how police violence affects different racial groups in the U.S.
