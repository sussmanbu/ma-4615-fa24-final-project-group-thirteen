    "text": "Fatal Police Shootings Data\nOur first data set contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US. This data was initially collected since the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. To combat this, our dataset aims to create a more comprehensive picture of police shootings, in what cases they come about, and which demographic groups these shootings tend to involve.\nWe are using data from fatal-police-shootings-data.csv with 14 variables:\n\nId: Presumably their criminal ID number. It is not specific to the order of the date of the shooting, so I think it is assigned based on another variable.\nName: The name of the person that got shot.\nDate: The day they were shot, from January 2015 - June 2020.\nManner_of_death: How they were killed by the police (shot/shot and tasered).\nArmed: Whether they were carrying a “weapon” at the time of arrest and shooting.\nAge: Age when shot.\nGender: Indicates whether male or female.\nRace:\n\nA = Asian\nW = White\nH = Hispanic\nB = Black\nN = Native American\nO = Other\n\nCity: Location where they were shot.\nState: What state the city is in.\nSigns_of_mental_illness: Whether or not the person shot was mentally ill.\nThreat_level: Indicates whether the police were in a threatened position (attack or other).\nFlee: Method of fleeing if they were, or if they weren’t.\nBody_camera: Whether the police were using a body camera during the arrest and shooting.\n\nOur dataset was fairly clean when we found it, making it relatively easy to interpret and work with. However, our “Race” variable is given by letters - A, W, H, B, N, and O - so are making an extra column “Race_Full” that has the full names of these variables such as “Asian” instead of “A” and “Native American” instead of “N”.\nThe code used for cleaning the dataset can be found here: Cleaning Dataset 1\nThe cleaned data could be found here: Dataset 1\n\nGiffords Law Center’s 2022 Scorecard\nOur second dataset, sourced from the Giffords Law Center, provides a comprehensive overview of gun policy strength across US states. This data is meticulously curated to assess the effectiveness of various gun laws and identify areas for potential reform. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover correlations between gun policy strength and gun violence rates.\nWe are using data from US_Gun_Statistics_Full_Data.csv with 7 variables:\n\nstate: The name of the US state.\nraw_score: The raw score assigned to the state based on its gun policy strength.\nmurders: The total number of murders in the state. murders_with_firearms: The number of murders committed with firearms in the state.\nactive_shooter_deaths: The number of deaths resulting from active shooter incidents in the state.\nsuicides_with_firearms: The number of suicides committed with firearms in the state.\npopulation: The total population of the state.\n\nThe data can be found here: Dataset 2\n\nMerged Dataset\nTo combine our datasets, we first addressed the inconsistency in state names. We created a new column in our original dataset that included both the state abbreviation and the full state name. This allowed us to merge the datasets based on this common column.\nSeveral irrelevant columns were removed during the cleaning process, including ‘Flee’, ‘id’, ‘body_camera’, and ‘officer name’. Additionally, we corrected errors in the state data, such as treating “DC” as a separate state and consolidating duplicate entries for Nevada. Finally, we removed any extra or incomplete rows to ensure data accuracy.\nAfter merging the datasets, we calculated the population proportion of each race and the population proportion of people of color for each state. This data was crucial for creating the interactive maps on our “Race and Policing” page.\nThe code used for merging and cleaning the datasets can be found here: Merging Datasets Code\nThe final merged dataset is available here: Final Merged Dataset"

    "text": "The Big Question:\nThesis: States with higher populations of people of color experience more fatal police shootings.\nThis analysis examines the relationship between state demographics and fatal police shootings, exploring whether states with higher proportions of people of color also report higher rates of police violence. By focusing on state-level data, we aim to uncover patterns that may reflect systemic issues in policing.\nWhy should you care?\nUnderstanding the correlation between race and police shootings is crucial to driving meaningful change. Engaging with this project helps spark important conversations about race, justice, and equality in America.\n\n\nHow You Can Explore the Data:\nThis interactive visual contains 2 maps, the first of which displays darker colors for states with higher proportions of people of color, while the second shows the number of fatal shootings per 100,000 residents. Clicking on states in the left graph will pull up a racial breakdown of that given state with a unique POC entry, allowing us to see individual racial groups as well as a statistic about the colored population as a whole in the state. Hovering over states in the right-most map will display the given state name and the number of shootings adjusted for population size to offer a clearer comparison. Having these two maps side-by-side gives insight into how states and areas with larger proportions of POC see more fatal police shootings.\n\n\n\n\nWhat the Interactive Maps Show:\n\nStates with higher populations of people of color tend to have higher rates of fatal police shootings, such as New Mexico, where 63.21% of the population is people of color and the fatal shooting rate is 5.08 per 100,000.\nSpecific racial groups, like Black and Hispanic populations, are more vulnerable to fatal shootings. Louisiana, with a large Black population (55.05%), has a relatively high rate of fatal shootings (2.36 per 100,000).\nSmaller POC populations, such as in New Hampshire (92.31% White), tend to have lower rates of fatal police shootings (0.98 per 100,000).\n\n\n\n\nA Deeper Look:\nWe’ve created two charts to break down fatal police shootings by race. The first shows the raw data, or the total number of fatalities by race. The second adjusts those numbers to account for the population size of each group. This helps us compare how different racial groups are affected by police violence, regardless of their population size.\n\n\nRaw Data Comparison:\nThe raw data simply counts the total number of fatal police shootings for each racial group. While this helps us understand the overall scale of police violence, it doesn’t account for the fact that some racial groups are larger than others in the U.S. population.\nRaw fatalities (from most to least):\n\nWhite: The highest total number of fatalities, reflecting the larger population of White Americans.\nBlack: The second-highest total, despite Black Americans representing a smaller portion of the population.\nHispanic: Fewer fatalities than White or Black groups, but still a significant number.\nOther, Native American, Asian: These groups experience fewer fatalities, but still face notable police violence.\n\nWhile raw data shows the total number of fatalities, it doesn’t give us a fair comparison of police violence between groups, as larger populations will naturally have more fatalities.\n\n\n\nRaw Fatal Police Shootings by Race\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Data Comparison:\nThe adjusted data takes population size into account, showing the rate of fatal police shootings per person in each racial group. This adjustment gives a clearer picture of how disproportionately each group is affected by fatal shootings.\nAdjusted fatal shootings (from most to least affected):\n\nBlack: Black communities have the highest rate of fatal police shootings, showing that they are disproportionately affected by police violence.\nOther: Multiracial and other non-Hispanic people of color also experience a higher rate of police violence compared to their population size.\nNative American: Native American communities also have a high rate, showing their vulnerability to police violence.\nHispanic: While lower than Black and Other groups, Hispanic communities still experience a notable rate of fatal shootings.\nWhite: White communities have a low rate of fatal police shootings, indicating that police violence is less common in predominantly White areas.\nAsian: Asian communities have the lowest rate, meaning they are the least affected relative to their population size.\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Fatal Police Shootings by Race\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the Difference?\nThe main difference between the raw data and adjusted data is that the raw data shows the total number of fatalities, which can be influenced by the size of each group. Larger groups, like White Americans, naturally have more fatalities because they make up a larger portion of the population. However, this doesn’t tell us how frequently different groups experience fatal police shootings.\nIn contrast, the adjusted data accounts for population size, showing the rate of fatal police shootings for each group. This adjustment reveals that Black communities experience fatal shootings at a much higher rate compared to their population size, which isn’t apparent in the raw data.\nBy comparing the raw data (total fatalities) with the adjusted data (rates), we get a fuller understanding of the issue. The raw data shows the overall scale of police violence, while the adjusted data reveals the disproportionate impact on smaller, marginalized communities—especially Black Americans. This distinction is crucial for understanding how police violence affects different racial groups in the U.S.\n\n\n\nVideo\nLink to Video"

    "text": "How are we continuing our exploratory data analysis?\nWe are deepening our exploratory data analysis by analyzing interaction between race, gender, age, and situational factors like threat level and armed status, adjusted for population proportion. Additionally, we are merging external dataset, such as the Giffords Law Center’s gun law scorecard, to explore the correlation between gun legislation and shooting rates. Visualizations, including an interactive map highlighting state level trends and disparities, are developed to enhance insights. Based on the EDA we have done so far, we got the most significant insight when comparing police shootings and racial proportions by state. To further delve into this analysis, we plan to make an interactive map using the shiny package. This visual will include two maps of the United States. The first will give insight about the frequency of fatal police shootings by population per state, while the second will have the population proportion of various racial groups where the viewer can choose which race to look into. Having these two maps side-by-side allows the user to see overlaps in how race interacts with shootings in the form of a map.\nOur Thesis\nPolice shootings occur more frequently in states with higher proportions of people of color, specifically Black, Native American, and Hispanic people.\nHow we plan to refine our visualizations and tables?\nWe are adjusting our dataset to include summary statistics of race populations in each state. This will allow for visualizations that are relevant to the frequency of police brutality in relation to race and a broad comparison between states. We plan to further polish our existing visuals by adding applicable axis titles, captions for clarity, color codes, and annotations when necessary. All of these changes serve to make our visualizations and tables easier to understand and draw insight from."

    "text": "Our initial analysis explored the breakdown of fatal shootings by race, gender, and age group, revealing several key trends. For instance, the data shows that White, non-Hispanic and Black, non-Hispanic individuals make up the largest groups affected by fatal police shootings. However, we’re questioning whether these numbers truly represent trends or are a result of data availability bias. To clarify, we plan to examine these racial breakdowns as proportions to see if disparities exist beyond the raw numbers. In terms of gender, our data indicates a significant imbalance, with males overwhelmingly represented among the victims. While this disparity is notable on its own, we’re also interested in exploring intersections with other factors, such as age or race, to see if these intersections provide additional insight into gender-based trends. For age, the most affected groups fall between 31-40, followed by 21-30 and 41-50, which may reflect broader demographic patterns or unique dynamics within police interactions. We’ll examine how age intersects with other variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding. When examining the data, we see that there is an overwhelming number of police shootings involving White and male victims. If we take a closer look (Figure 1), we notice that the proportion of males and females who are shot varies based on race . This means that there are trends across races where we see women make up a larger, albeit still tiny, proportion of those shot.\nFor Figure 2 in this week’s analysis, we included a bar chart illustrating the number of fatal shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group’s proportion of the U.S. population. This will help identify potential over-representation and give a clearer picture of any disparities. The bar chart illustrating the number of fatal police shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group’s proportion of the U.S. population indicates that Black individuals have the highest proportion of fatal shootings when adjusted for population size, highlighting a critical area of concern. Conversely, the adjusted figures show that White individuals now represent one of the lowest proportions among the groups analyzed, a stark contrast to previous findings. This adjustment underscores the importance of considering population proportions when analyzing fatal police shootings, as it significantly alters the interpretation of racial disparities and calls for a deeper investigation into the underlying factors contributing to these trends.\nFigure 3 presents the results of the logistic regression model, which examines the relationship between signs of mental illness and the manner of death (e.g., “shot” vs. “shot and Tasered”). The analysis suggests that individuals with mental illness may be more likely to be shot rather than shot and Tasered, implying that police officers may use less force (such as a Taser) when they do not perceive a significant mental health crisis or threat. Conversely, the majority of cases involving “shot and Tasered” appear to involve individuals without identifiable signs of mental illness. This trend raises important questions about how mental illness status might influence police decision-making in high-stress situations, potentially reflecting a differential response based on perceived threat levels. The findings underscore the need for further investigation into how mental health awareness and training for law enforcement could impact outcomes in such encounters.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3"

    "text": "After receiving feedback about our data sets from Prof. Sussman, we decided to take a closer look at Data Set 1. The data was collected by the U.S. Department of Education as a comprehensive data set of college characteristics, enrollment, aid, costs, and student outcomes of all U.S. institutions from 1996-2023. The file contains separate csv files for each year which will pose a potential issue because there is so much data. In addition, it is very hard to interpret all of the variable names in the csv file. From what we could tell, there is data about proportions of admissions, average income after graduation, tuition costs, debt/loans taken, and demographic details partitioned between male and female students/applicants. There are also a lot of N/A fields in the data that would require extra cleaning and interpretation.\nThe College Scorecard has two separate data sets, one for institution characteristics, and broken down by field study at each institution."

    "text": "Our team, after exploring the data from the U.S. Department of Education for the College Scorecard that was presented in Blog Post 2, decided to shift to a new dataset. The previous one had data spanning years and covered institutional characteristics, enrollment, student aid, and student outcomes of colleges across the U.S. However, the data was dispersed across many files - one for each year from 1996 to 2023 - and was very inconsistent across yearly datasets. Specifically, there were dozens of null columns in earlier sets that were filled in for later ones, making it difficult to see how certain factors change over time. Overall, this dataset on student completion, debt and repayment, earnings, and more was very inconsistent and scattered, making it difficult for us to use and draw insight from.\nWe have since shifted to a dataset on fatal police shootings that is much more cohesive. This dataset has 14 columns and 5.4K rows, and contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US. Some variables include race, whether the victim was armed, their age, gender, and location. This data was initially collected since the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. The dataset is able to be loaded and cleaned but seems to have some entries missing race data on victims. There are some possible biases to think about - this dataset may contain more shootings that were digitally documented and therefore officers felt pressure to record the instance officially. This means that there may be events that were not recorded with a camera or an audio device, so nobody knew to document the instance other than the offensive officer who may not want it on record.\nWith this data, we would like to draw insight on how race, gender, and age play into fatal police shooting trends.\n\n\n\nRace Image\n\n\n\n\n\nGender Image\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Image"

    "text": "For our second dataset, we chose Giffords Law Center’s 2022 Scorecard, which uses a grading system to rank the states. The data is updated annually with a ranking that considers factors like background checks, firearm restrictions, and regulation of assault weapons. All fifty states are ranked based on thirty policy approaches to regulating guns and ammunition. States received points for stronger laws and lost points for weaker laws.\nOur idea is to combine data sets that relate to the access of guns in each state with the intention of analyzing how strict gun laws correlate to how much gun violence there is for the state in our original data set. A possible method of doing this is to create a new merged data set by reading the individual csv files and mutating new columns for the data that is relevant to our analysis. We have downloaded the scorecard file on gun policy strictness and are currently working merging the datasets in RStudio so that we can start our initial exploratory analysis.\nHere is a link to the website where we pulled our data from: https://brady-score.github.io/"

    "text": "We began by merging our datasets, but encountered an issue with the state columns, which were inconsistent between the two datasets. The original dataset used state abbreviations, while the Brady Score dataset used full state names. To resolve this, we created a new column in the original dataset that combined both the full state names and their abbreviations. This allowed us to join the datasets on the newly created column for consistency. During the cleaning process, we also removed several columns that were not relevant to our analysis, including ‘Flee’, ‘id’, ‘body_camera’, and ‘officer name’. These columns were either redundant or unnecessary for our investigation. Additionally, we identified and corrected a couple of issues with the state data. For example, “DC” was mistakenly treated as a separate state, but it was merged into Maryland’s total since Washington, D.C. should be part of Maryland’s statistics. Similarly, Nevada (NV) appeared as two separate entries in our dataset, so we consolidated these rows to ensure they reflected the correct totals for Nevada. Finally, we removed any extra or incomplete rows that may have been left over from previous cleaning steps, ensuring that the dataset only contains valid and complete data for our analysis. This process ensured that our dataset was consistent and ready for further analysis.\nIn this analysis, we first explored the distribution of gender counts by state, visualizing the male and female population in each state using a side-by-side bar plot. We then examined the relationship between murders with firearms and population by state through a scatter plot, highlighting how firearm-related murders correlate with state population size. Finally, we built a linear regression model to predict murders with firearms, and visualized the model’s performance by plotting the actual vs. predicted values. This comparison allowed us to assess how well the model’s predictions align with the observed data, providing insight into its accuracy and potential areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n Additional Analysis:\nArmed vs Unarmed Cases by State (Top 15): California leads with the highest number of both armed and unarmed cases, followed by Texas and Florida. Across all states, armed cases significantly outnumber unarmed cases, showing a consistent pattern regardless of state size or location. \nMental Illness Cases vs Total Cases by State: There’s a clear positive correlation - as total cases increase, mental illness cases also increase. California stands as an outlier with both the highest total and mental illness cases, while most states cluster together with fewer than 200 total cases and 50 mental illness cases. \nPercentage of Female Cases by State (Top 20): The data shows a striking gender disparity across all states, with female cases making up only 4-7% of total cases. Georgia leads with the highest percentage of female cases, but even there, males account for over 93% of all cases."

The dataset comprises 174 columns and 214,886 rows, covering data from the 1996-97 to the 2022-23 academic years. It includes institution-level data, such as enrollment, student aid, costs, and outcomes, and field of study-level data that provides insights on debt at graduation and earnings one year post-graduation. Originally collected to help prospective students make informed choices, the dataset highlights disparities in education related to race, socio-economic status, debt accumulation, and federal funding distribution. Although the data can be cleaned and loaded, its large size may present challenges in analysis.\nData set 2\nAge-by-Race Specific Crime Rates, 1965-1985: [United States] https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-by-race-specific-crime-rates-1965-1985-united-states-b16aa\nIt is not clear in the description how many rows and columns there are in the dataset, but the variables are categorized into 4 subgroups per race and age over a 21 year time frame. The data was collected by the FBI “Uniform Crime Reports: Crime in the United States” and was aggregated. Using this data, we can answer questions that relate age-by-race crime to crime rates over 21 years. We can also take into account current events of the 1960s-1980s to consider if specific age cohorts had more reported crime rates. For example, we can consider the Baby Boom era and relate it to crime rates post WW2. We can also see which types of crimes were most committed by age-race group per period of time and see if this data is reflective of national crime trends. A challenge I foresee is being able to synthesize categorized data like this in the most effective way. A way to combat this is to focus on a specific crime across the 21 year time frame and analyze the relationship between age-by-race subgroups rather than try to understand many different variables of the same category all at once.\nData set 3\nData Police shootings https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/data-police-shootings?resource=download\nThis dataset has 14 columns and 5.4K rows, and contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US.

    "text": "In this analysis, we explore the complex relationship between shooting incidents and race, with particular emphasis on racial proportions in different areas and their correlation with shooting frequency. Additionally, we examine how state-level gun restrictions might influence shooting rates, leveraging a dataset that merges information on police shootings with data on firearm regulations.\nThe central questions guiding our analysis are: 1. Does mental health status impact fatalities? 2. Do areas with higher proportions of people of color see more shootings? 3. Do states with more firearm precautions and restrictions have lower frequencies of shootings?\nThrough rigorous statistical techniques, we aim to answer these questions by identifying patterns and relationships in the data using a series of figures and tables that clearly illustrate how racial demographics and firearm regulations interact with shooting incidents. This comprehensive analysis integrates both the police shooting data and the additional gun restriction dataset to provide a nuanced view of how race, shootings, and gun laws are interconnected.\nThe figures below highlight key insights and patterns related to these relationships, offering a deeper understanding of the factors influencing shooting frequencies and their demographic implications.\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nDoes mental health status impact fatalities?\n\nThe scatter plot shows a wide variation in the number of mental illness cases across the states, with most points clustering around values below 50 for mental illness cases (the x-axis). However, the fatal shootings rate (the y-axis) shows a much more scattered distribution, with points ranging from very low to quite high fatal shootings rates, indicating significant variability in the number of fatal shootings across states, regardless of the number of mental illness cases.\nThis could suggest that while mental illness cases may be a factor in some states, they do not consistently predict the frequency of fatal shootings. The scattered nature of the y-axis implies that other factors—such as police practices, gun laws, socioeconomic conditions, or racial disparities—might also play a significant role in the frequency of fatal shootings, beyond just the number of mental illness cases. Therefore, while there might be some correlation between mental health and fatalities in certain areas, mental illness alone may not fully explain the differences in shooting rates across states.\nIn relation to the question “Does mental health status impact fatalities?”, the data suggests that mental health status, as measured by mental illness cases, does not appear to have a clear, consistent relationship with the frequency of fatal shootings. Further analysis would be needed to explore other potential factors that could explain the variation in fatal shootings rates across states.\n\nThis analysis uses a logistic regression model to evaluate fatal police shooting outcomes and predictors, focusing on mental health status. The model shows significant patterns in the data, but significant unexplained variation persists (Pseudo R2 = 0.224, AIC = 1605.1). Because the outcome variable is binary (fatal vs. non fatal), logistic regression was used to predict probability relationships.\nModel predictors were chosen based on theory and evidence. The main predictors include mental health, gender, race, armed status, threat level, and fled status. These variables were chosen because they may affect police-civilian relations and have been studied. The distribution of red dots (mental illness present) and blue dots (no mental illness) over probability levels shows how mental health status affects outcomes.\nThe model’s projected probabilities and outcomes indicate an S-shaped connection, with the greatest change between 50% and 75% probability. The model’s predictions’ confidence interval, the grey band around the curve, indicates uncertainty. The model is most accurate at forecasting clearly high-risk or low-risk events since this uncertainty is lowest at the extremes (between 0% and 100% probability) and highest in the middle. The concentration of cases at both ends of the likelihood spectrum, particularly mental illness cases in higher risk regions, shows a strong link between mental health and police encounter fatalities.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nDo areas with higher proportions of people of color see more shootings?\n\nThe figure demonstrates a positive linear correlation between the proportion of people of color (POC) in a state and the fatal shooting rate (per 100,000 residents). Points with higher POC proportions, represented in red, consistently exhibit higher actual and predicted shooting rates. This pattern aligns with the question, reinforcing that states with larger populations of people of color experience disproportionately higher rates of fatal police shootings.\n\nThe scatter plots faceted by the proportion of people of color (POC) illustrate a noticeable trend between higher POC proportions and an increase in the frequency of fatal shootings. In areas with a low POC proportion, the points are concentrated within a range of (0, 0) to (100, 300), suggesting that these areas experience relatively fewer fatal shootings. Both actual and predicted counts of fatal shootings remain low in these regions. As the POC proportion increases to medium levels, the range expands slightly to (0, 0) to (200, 300), indicating a modest rise in shooting incidents. This suggests that areas with medium proportions of people of color tend to experience slightly more shootings than those with lower POC proportions.\nIn areas with a high POC proportion, the range extends from (0, 0) to (350, 500), showing a clear increase in both observed and predicted fatal shootings. This indicates that higher POC areas are associated with a higher frequency of shootings, with greater variability in the data. Finally, in regions with very high POC proportions, the range of shooting counts extends even further, from (0, 0) to (800, 3500), indicating some extreme outliers. This suggests that areas with the highest proportions of people of color are significantly more likely to experience fatal shootings, both in terms of observed data and model predictions.\nThese trends suggest that areas with higher proportions of people of color tend to see more fatal shootings. However, this relationship does not imply direct causality. Other factors, such as socioeconomic conditions, systemic inequalities, and community-policing dynamics, may also contribute to the higher shooting rates in these areas. Further analysis is needed to explore these factors in more depth and better understand the underlying causes of these disparities.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3:\nDo states with more firearm precautions and restrictions have lower frequencies of shootings?\n The boxplot reveals an interesting relationship between gun law strictness and fatal shootings rates across three categories: low, medium, and high strictness. States with low gun law strictness have a median fatal shootings rate of approximately 2.4, with a smaller range, indicating less variability in shooting rates. In contrast, states with medium strictness have a slightly lower median rate of 2.0, but with a wider interquartile range, suggesting more variation in shooting rates within this category. For states with high gun law strictness, the median fatal shootings rate drops to around 1.6, the lowest of the three categories. However, the range of shooting rates in this category is the largest, pointing to greater variability. This suggests that while stricter gun laws may be associated with lower fatal shootings rates on average, their impact can vary significantly from state to state.\n\nThe graph illustrates the relationship between Gun Law Scores (where higher scores indicate stricter laws) and Shooting Rates (measured as shootings per 100,000 population) across various states. The downward-sloping regression line, accompanied by a shaded confidence interval, reveals a clear negative correlation: states with stricter gun laws tend to experience lower shooting rates. For example, states with Gun Law Scores above 30, such as those likely representing stricter gun control states like California or New York, tend to cluster around lower shooting rates, close to 1 or fewer per 100,000 people. In contrast, states with Gun Law Scores near or below 10, potentially states like Mississippi or Louisiana, often show significantly higher shooting rates, in some cases exceeding 4 or 5 per 100,000 people.\nState population, represented by the size of the bubbles, does not seem to strongly influence the overall trend. Larger states, like Texas or Florida, appear distributed along the regression line, reinforcing the idea that the negative relationship between gun law strictness and shooting rates holds regardless of population size. Notably, states with weaker gun laws often experience higher shooting rates, such as the outliers seen in the lower Gun Law Score range, where shooting rates rise above the general trend. Conversely, states with stricter gun laws tend to cluster toward the lower end of shooting rates, demonstrating a consistent association between strong regulation and reduced shootings.\nWhile this graph does not establish causation, it highlights a consistent and meaningful correlation between stricter gun legislation and reduced shooting rates. For instance, states that implement and enforce stricter gun control measures, such as background checks, firearm permits, or bans on certain weapons, may see fewer incidents of gun violence. This data suggests that stricter gun laws could play a role in mitigating shooting rates across states.\n\n\n\nTakeaways:\nIn conclusion, our analysis reveals several important insights into the complex factors that influence police shooting incidents. First, while mental health status shows some correlation with shooting fatalities, it does not emerge as a clear, consistent predictor. The variability in shooting outcomes suggests that other factors, such as police practices, racial dynamics, and gun laws, may be more significant drivers. Second, areas with higher proportions of people of color tend to experience higher rates of fatal shootings, though it is important to note that this relationship is influenced by various other factors like socioeconomic conditions and systemic inequalities. Finally, stricter gun laws appear to be associated with lower rates of fatal shootings, suggesting that firearm regulations could play a role in reducing gun violence, although further research is needed to establish causality. Ultimately, this analysis underscores the need for a multi-faceted approach to addressing police shootings, considering not just race and gun laws, but also the broader social and systemic factors at play."
