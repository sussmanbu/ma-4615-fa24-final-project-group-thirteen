    "text": "After receiving feedback about our data sets from Prof. Sussman, we decided to take a closer look at Data Set 1. The data was collected by the U.S. Department of Education as a comprehensive data set of college characteristics, enrollment, aid, costs, and student outcomes of all U.S. institutions from 1996-2023. The file contains separate csv files for each year which will pose a potential issue because there is so much data. In addition, it is very hard to interpret all of the variable names in the csv file. From what we could tell, there is data about proportions of admissions, average income after graduation, tuition costs, debt/loans taken, and demographic details partitioned between male and female students/applicants. There are also a lot of N/A fields in the data that would require extra cleaning and interpretation.\nThe College Scorecard has two separate data sets, one for institution characteristics, and broken down by field study at each institution."

    "text": "Our team, after exploring the data from the U.S. Department of Education for the College Scorecard that was presented in Blog Post 2, decided to shift to a new dataset. The previous one had data spanning years and covered institutional characteristics, enrollment, student aid, and student outcomes of colleges across the U.S. However, the data was dispersed across many files - one for each year from 1996 to 2023 - and was very inconsistent across yearly datasets. Specifically, there were dozens of null columns in earlier sets that were filled in for later ones, making it difficult to see how certain factors change over time. Overall, this dataset on student completion, debt and repayment, earnings, and more was very inconsistent and scattered, making it difficult for us to use and draw insight from.\nWe have since shifted to a dataset on fatal police shootings that is much more cohesive. This dataset has 14 columns and 5.4K rows, and contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US. Some variables include race, whether the victim was armed, their age, gender, and location. This data was initially collected since the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. The dataset is able to be loaded and cleaned but seems to have some entries missing race data on victims. There are some possible biases to think about - this dataset may contain more shootings that were digitally documented and therefore officers felt pressure to record the instance officially. This means that there may be events that were not recorded with a camera or an audio device, so nobody knew to document the instance other than the offensive officer who may not want it on record.\nWith this data, we would like to draw insight on how race, gender, and age play into fatal police shooting trends.\n\n\n\nRace Image\n\n\n\n\n\nGender Image\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Image"

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Our initial analysis explored the breakdown of fatal shootings by race, gender, and age group, revealing several key trends. For instance, the data shows that White, non-Hispanic and Black, non-Hispanic individuals make up the largest groups affected by fatal police shootings. However, we’re questioning whether these numbers truly represent trends or are a result of data availability bias. To clarify, we plan to examine these racial breakdowns as proportions to see if disparities exist beyond the raw numbers. In terms of gender, our data indicates a significant imbalance, with males overwhelmingly represented among the victims. While this disparity is notable on its own, we’re also interested in exploring intersections with other factors, such as age or race, to see if these intersections provide additional insight into gender-based trends. For age, the most affected groups fall between 31-40, followed by 21-30 and 41-50, which may reflect broader demographic patterns or unique dynamics within police interactions. We’ll examine how age intersects with other variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding. When examining the data, we see that there is an overwhelming number of police shootings involving White and male victims. If we take a closer look (Figure 1), we notice that the proportion of males and females who are shot varies based on race . This means that there are trends across races where we see women make up a larger, albeit still tiny, proportion of those shot.\nFor Figure 2 in this week’s analysis, we included a bar chart illustrating the number of fatal shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group’s proportion of the U.S. population. This will help identify potential over-representation and give a clearer picture of any disparities. The bar chart illustrating the number of fatal police shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group’s proportion of the U.S. population indicates that Black individuals have the highest proportion of fatal shootings when adjusted for population size, highlighting a critical area of concern. Conversely, the adjusted figures show that White individuals now represent one of the lowest proportions among the groups analyzed, a stark contrast to previous findings. This adjustment underscores the importance of considering population proportions when analyzing fatal police shootings, as it significantly alters the interpretation of racial disparities and calls for a deeper investigation into the underlying factors contributing to these trends.\nFigure 3 presents the results of the logistic regression model, which examines the relationship between signs of mental illness and the manner of death (e.g., “shot” vs. “shot and Tasered”). The analysis suggests that individuals with mental illness may be more likely to be shot rather than shot and Tasered, implying that police officers may use less force (such as a Taser) when they do not perceive a significant mental health crisis or threat. Conversely, the majority of cases involving “shot and Tasered” appear to involve individuals without identifiable signs of mental illness. This trend raises important questions about how mental illness status might influence police decision-making in high-stress situations, potentially reflecting a differential response based on perceived threat levels. The findings underscore the need for further investigation into how mental health awareness and training for law enforcement could impact outcomes in such encounters.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3"

    "text": "Data set 1\nU.S. Department of Education: College Scorecard https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard dataset provides comprehensive data on institutions of higher education, aiming to enhance transparency regarding student outcomes and institutional characteristics. The dataset comprises 174 columns and 214,886 rows, covering data from the 1996-97 to the 2022-23 academic years. It includes institution-level data, such as enrollment, student aid, costs, and outcomes, and field of study-level data that provides insights on debt at graduation and earnings one year post-graduation. Originally collected to help prospective students make informed choices, the dataset highlights disparities in education related to race, socio-economic status, debt accumulation, and federal funding distribution. Although the data can be cleaned and loaded, its large size may present challenges in analysis.\nData set 2\nAge-by-Race Specific Crime Rates, 1965-1985: [United States] https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-by-race-specific-crime-rates-1965-1985-united-states-b16aa\nIt is not clear in the description how many rows and columns there are in the dataset, but the variables are categorized into 4 subgroups per race and age over a 21 year time frame. The data was collected by the FBI “Uniform Crime Reports: Crime in the United States” and was aggregated. Using this data, we can answer questions that relate age-by-race crime to crime rates over 21 years. We can also take into account current events of the 1960s-1980s to consider if specific age cohorts had more reported crime rates. For example, we can consider the Baby Boom era and relate it to crime rates post WW2. We can also see which types of crimes were most committed by age-race group per period of time and see if this data is reflective of national crime trends. A challenge I foresee is being able to synthesize categorized data like this in the most effective way. A way to combat this is to focus on a specific crime across the 21 year time frame and analyze the relationship between age-by-race subgroups rather than try to understand many different variables of the same category all at once.\nData set 3\nData Police shootings https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/data-police-shootings?resource=download\nThis dataset has 14 columns and 5.4K rows, and contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US.

The dataset is able to be loaded and cleaned but seems to have some entries missing race data on victims, which might be a problem. With this information, we would like to draw insight on how race, gender, and age play into fatal police shooting trends."

Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
