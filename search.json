    "text": "Fatal Police Shootings Data\nOur first data set contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US. This data was initially collected since the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. To combat this, our dataset aims to create a more comprehensive picture of police shootings, in what cases they come about, and which demographic groups these shootings tend to involve.\nWe are using data from fatal-police-shootings-data.csv with 14 variables:\n\nId: Presumably their criminal ID number. It is not specific to the order of the date of the shooting, so I think it is assigned based on another variable.\nName: The name of the person that got shot.\nDate: The day they were shot, from January 2015 - June 2020.\nManner_of_death: How they were killed by the police (shot/shot and tasered).\nArmed: Whether they were carrying a “weapon” at the time of arrest and shooting.\nAge: Age when shot.\nGender: Indicates whether male or female.\nRace:\n\nA = Asian\nW = White\nH = Hispanic\nB = Black\nN = Native American\nO = Other\n\nCity: Location where they were shot.\nState: What state the city is in.\nSigns_of_mental_illness: Whether or not the person shot was mentally ill.\nThreat_level: Indicates whether the police were in a threatened position (attack or other).\nFlee: Method of fleeing if they were, or if they weren’t.\nBody_camera: Whether the police were using a body camera during the arrest and shooting.\n\nOur dataset was fairly clean when we found it, making it relatively easy to interpret and work with. However, our “Race” variable is given by letters - A, W, H, B, N, and O - so are making an extra column “Race_Full” that has the full names of these variables such as “Asian” instead of “A” and “Native American” instead of “N”.\nThe code used for cleaning the dataset can be found here: Cleaning Dataset 1\nThe cleaned data could be found here: Dataset 1\n\nGiffords Law Center’s 2022 Scorecard\nOur second dataset, sourced from the Giffords Law Center, provides a comprehensive overview of gun policy strength across US states. This data is meticulously curated to assess the effectiveness of various gun laws and identify areas for potential reform. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover correlations between gun policy strength and gun violence rates.\nWe are using data from US_Gun_Statistics_Full_Data.csv with 7 variables:\n\nstate: The name of the US state.\nraw_score: The raw score assigned to the state based on its gun policy strength.\nmurders: The total number of murders in the state. murders_with_firearms: The number of murders committed with firearms in the state.\nactive_shooter_deaths: The number of deaths resulting from active shooter incidents in the state.\nsuicides_with_firearms: The number of suicides committed with firearms in the state.\npopulation: The total population of the state.\n\nThe data can be found here: Dataset 2\n\nMerged Dataset\nTo combine our datasets, we first addressed the inconsistency in state names. We created a new column in our original dataset that included both the state abbreviation and the full state name. This allowed us to merge the datasets based on this common column.\nSeveral irrelevant columns were removed during the cleaning process, including ‘Flee’, ‘id’, ‘body_camera’, and ‘officer name’. Additionally, we corrected errors in the state data, such as treating “DC” as a separate state and consolidating duplicate entries for Nevada. Finally, we removed any extra or incomplete rows to ensure data accuracy.\nAfter merging the datasets, we calculated the population proportion of each race and the population proportion of people of color for each state. This data was crucial for creating the interactive maps on our “Race and Policing” page.\nThe code used for merging and cleaning the datasets can be found here: Merging Datasets Code\nThe final merged dataset is available here: Final Merged Dataset"

    "text": "The Big Question:\nDo states with higher populations of people of color experience more fatal police shootings?\nIn recent years, the issue of police shootings, particularly those involving people of color, has sparked intense debate across the U.S. But what if the frequency of these shootings is not just about individual cases or isolated incidents? What if the location and demographics of each state play a significant role? This project explores how the proportion of people of color in each state may influence the rate of fatal police shootings. It’s a conversation that is essential for understanding systemic issues within policing, and it’s a story you’ll explore through interactive data and compelling visualizations.\nOur research suggests that there’s a connection: states with higher proportions of people of color tend to see more fatal police shootings. But we’re not just telling you that—this project lets you explore that question in detail through data, and gives you the tools to understand this important issue for yourself.\n\n\nHow You Can Explore the Data:\nWe’ve created interactive maps that let you compare the racial makeup of each state with the number of fatal police shootings. It’s an easy way to visually understand the connection between race and police violence. Here’s how to engage:\n\nMap 1: Proportion of People of Color This map shows the percentage of people of color in each state. The darker the state, the higher the proportion of people of color living there.\nMap 2: Fatal Police Shootings This map shows the total number of fatal police shootings by state. Again, darker states represent those with more shootings.\n\nYou can click on any state to get the exact numbers and compare them side by side. Do states with high proportions of people of color also have high numbers of police shootings? What patterns emerge as you explore the maps?\nThese interactive tools give you the power to see for yourself how race and policing are connected across the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Deeper Look:\nTo add more context, we’ve also created a detailed figure that breaks down fatal police shootings by race, adjusted for population size. This means you can see which racial groups experience the most fatal police shootings relative to their size in the population.\n\nFatal Police Shootings by Race (Adjusted for Population Proportion): This chart organizes racial groups from highest to lowest in terms of fatal shootings, giving you a clearer picture of who is most affected when taking population size into account. The chart shows the stark disparities in how different racial groups are impacted by police violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\nThis is more than just data—it’s about understanding the larger picture. Our findings raise critical questions about the role that race plays in policing. By exploring this data, you can see firsthand how systemic issues affect different communities. It’s not just about statistics; it’s about real lives, real people, and the urgent need for reform.\nBy engaging with this project, you’re not just learning about data; you’re learning about the real-world implications of race and policing in America. It’s a chance to reflect, ask tough questions, and, most importantly, think about how we can create a more just society for everyone.\nSo, why should you care?\nBecause this issue affects all of us. Understanding the correlation between race and police shootings is crucial to pushing for meaningful change. By engaging with this project, you’re diving into an important conversation about race, justice, and equality in America.\nExplore the data, draw your own conclusions, and become part of the conversation."

    "text": "How are we continuing our exploratory data analysis?\nWe are deepening our exploratory data analysis by analyzing interaction between race, gender, age, and situational factors like threat level and armed status, adjusted for population proportion. Additionally, we are merging external dataset, such as the Giffords Law Center’s gun law scorecard, to explore the correlation between gun legislation and shooting rates. Visualizations, including an interactive map highlighting state level trends and disparities, are developed to enhance insights. Based on the EDA we have done so far, we got the most significant insight when comparing police shootings and racial proportions by state. To further delve into this analysis, we plan to make an interactive map using the shiny package. This visual will include two maps of the United States. The first will give insight about the frequency of fatal police shootings by population per state, while the second will have the population proportion of various racial groups where the viewer can choose which race to look into. Having these two maps side-by-side allows the user to see overlaps in how race interacts with shootings in the form of a map.\nOur Thesis\nPolice shootings occur more frequently in states with higher proportions of people of color, specifically Black, Native American, and Hispanic people.\nHow we plan to refine our visualizations and tables?\nWe are adjusting our dataset to include summary statistics of race populations in each state. This will allow for visualizations that are relevant to the frequency of police brutality in relation to race and a broad comparison between states. We plan to further polish our existing visuals by adding applicable axis titles, captions for clarity, color codes, and annotations when necessary. All of these changes serve to make our visualizations and tables easier to understand and draw insight from."

    "text": "Our initial analysis explored the breakdown of fatal shootings by race, gender, and age group, revealing several key trends. For instance, the data shows that White, non-Hispanic and Black, non-Hispanic individuals make up the largest groups affected by fatal police shootings. However, we’re questioning whether these numbers truly represent trends or are a result of data availability bias. To clarify, we plan to examine these racial breakdowns as proportions to see if disparities exist beyond the raw numbers. In terms of gender, our data indicates a significant imbalance, with males overwhelmingly represented among the victims. While this disparity is notable on its own, we’re also interested in exploring intersections with other factors, such as age or race, to see if these intersections provide additional insight into gender-based trends. For age, the most affected groups fall between 31-40, followed by 21-30 and 41-50, which may reflect broader demographic patterns or unique dynamics within police interactions. We’ll examine how age intersects with other variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding. When examining the data, we see that there is an overwhelming number of police shootings involving White and male victims. If we take a closer look (Figure 1), we notice that the proportion of males and females who are shot varies based on race . This means that there are trends across races where we see women make up a larger, albeit still tiny, proportion of those shot.\nFor Figure 2 in this week’s analysis, we included a bar chart illustrating the number of fatal shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group’s proportion of the U.S. population. This will help identify potential over-representation and give a clearer picture of any disparities. The bar chart illustrating the number of fatal police shootings by race, adjusted to reflect each racial group’s proportion of the U.S. population indicates that Black individuals have the highest proportion of fatal shootings when adjusted for population size, highlighting a critical area of concern. Conversely, the adjusted figures show that White individuals now represent one of the lowest proportions among the groups analyzed, a stark contrast to previous findings. This adjustment underscores the importance of considering population proportions when analyzing fatal police shootings, as it significantly alters the interpretation of racial disparities and calls for a deeper investigation into the underlying factors contributing to these trends.\nFigure 3 presents the results of the logistic regression model, which examines the relationship between signs of mental illness and the manner of death (e.g., “shot” vs. “shot and Tasered”). The analysis suggests that individuals with mental illness may be more likely to be shot rather than shot and Tasered, implying that police officers may use less force (such as a Taser) when they do not perceive a significant mental health crisis or threat. Conversely, the majority of cases involving “shot and Tasered” appear to involve individuals without identifiable signs of mental illness. This trend raises important questions about how mental illness status might influence police decision-making in high-stress situations, potentially reflecting a differential response based on perceived threat levels. The findings underscore the need for further investigation into how mental health awareness and training for law enforcement could impact outcomes in such encounters.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3"

    "text": "After receiving feedback about our data sets from Prof. Sussman, we decided to take a closer look at Data Set 1. The data was collected by the U.S. Department of Education as a comprehensive data set of college characteristics, enrollment, aid, costs, and student outcomes of all U.S. institutions from 1996-2023. The file contains separate csv files for each year which will pose a potential issue because there is so much data. In addition, it is very hard to interpret all of the variable names in the csv file. From what we could tell, there is data about proportions of admissions, average income after graduation, tuition costs, debt/loans taken, and demographic details partitioned between male and female students/applicants. There are also a lot of N/A fields in the data that would require extra cleaning and interpretation.\nThe College Scorecard has two separate data sets, one for institution characteristics, and broken down by field study at each institution."

    "text": "Our team, after exploring the data from the U.S. Department of Education for the College Scorecard that was presented in Blog Post 2, decided to shift to a new dataset. The previous one had data spanning years and covered institutional characteristics, enrollment, student aid, and student outcomes of colleges across the U.S. However, the data was dispersed across many files - one for each year from 1996 to 2023 - and was very inconsistent across yearly datasets. Specifically, there were dozens of null columns in earlier sets that were filled in for later ones, making it difficult to see how certain factors change over time. Overall, this dataset on student completion, debt and repayment, earnings, and more was very inconsistent and scattered, making it difficult for us to use and draw insight from.\nWe have since shifted to a dataset on fatal police shootings that is much more cohesive. This dataset has 14 columns and 5.4K rows, and contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US. Some variables include race, whether the victim was armed, their age, gender, and location. This data was initially collected since the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. The dataset is able to be loaded and cleaned but seems to have some entries missing race data on victims. There are some possible biases to think about - this dataset may contain more shootings that were digitally documented and therefore officers felt pressure to record the instance officially. This means that there may be events that were not recorded with a camera or an audio device, so nobody knew to document the instance other than the offensive officer who may not want it on record.\nWith this data, we would like to draw insight on how race, gender, and age play into fatal police shooting trends.\n\n\n\nRace Image\n\n\n\n\n\nGender Image\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Image"

    "text": "For our second dataset, we chose Giffords Law Center’s 2022 Scorecard, which uses a grading system to rank the states. The data is updated annually with a ranking that considers factors like background checks, firearm restrictions, and regulation of assault weapons. All fifty states are ranked based on thirty policy approaches to regulating guns and ammunition. States received points for stronger laws and lost points for weaker laws.\nOur idea is to combine data sets that relate to the access of guns in each state with the intention of analyzing how strict gun laws correlate to how much gun violence there is for the state in our original data set. A possible method of doing this is to create a new merged data set by reading the individual csv files and mutating new columns for the data that is relevant to our analysis. We have downloaded the scorecard file on gun policy strictness and are currently working merging the datasets in RStudio so that we can start our initial exploratory analysis.\nHere is a link to the website where we pulled our data from: https://brady-score.github.io/"

    "text": "We began by merging our datasets, but encountered an issue with the state columns, which were inconsistent between the two datasets. The original dataset used state abbreviations, while the Brady Score dataset used full state names. To resolve this, we created a new column in the original dataset that combined both the full state names and their abbreviations. This allowed us to join the datasets on the newly created column for consistency. During the cleaning process, we also removed several columns that were not relevant to our analysis, including ‘Flee’, ‘id’, ‘body_camera’, and ‘officer name’. These columns were either redundant or unnecessary for our investigation. Additionally, we identified and corrected a couple of issues with the state data. For example, “DC” was mistakenly treated as a separate state, but it was merged into Maryland’s total since Washington, D.C. should be part of Maryland’s statistics. Similarly, Nevada (NV) appeared as two separate entries in our dataset, so we consolidated these rows to ensure they reflected the correct totals for Nevada. Finally, we removed any extra or incomplete rows that may have been left over from previous cleaning steps, ensuring that the dataset only contains valid and complete data for our analysis. This process ensured that our dataset was consistent and ready for further analysis.\nIn this analysis, we first explored the distribution of gender counts by state, visualizing the male and female population in each state using a side-by-side bar plot. We then examined the relationship between murders with firearms and population by state through a scatter plot, highlighting how firearm-related murders correlate with state population size. Finally, we built a linear regression model to predict murders with firearms, and visualized the model’s performance by plotting the actual vs. predicted values. This comparison allowed us to assess how well the model’s predictions align with the observed data, providing insight into its accuracy and potential areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n Additional Analysis:\nArmed vs Unarmed Cases by State (Top 15): California leads with the highest number of both armed and unarmed cases, followed by Texas and Florida. Across all states, armed cases significantly outnumber unarmed cases, showing a consistent pattern regardless of state size or location. \nMental Illness Cases vs Total Cases by State: There’s a clear positive correlation - as total cases increase, mental illness cases also increase. California stands as an outlier with both the highest total and mental illness cases, while most states cluster together with fewer than 200 total cases and 50 mental illness cases. \nPercentage of Female Cases by State (Top 20): The data shows a striking gender disparity across all states, with female cases making up only 4-7% of total cases. Georgia leads with the highest percentage of female cases, but even there, males account for over 93% of all cases."

    "text": "Data set 1\nU.S. Department of Education: College Scorecard https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard dataset provides comprehensive data on institutions of higher education, aiming to enhance transparency regarding student outcomes and institutional characteristics. The dataset comprises 174 columns and 214,886 rows, covering data from the 1996-97 to the 2022-23 academic years. It includes institution-level data, such as enrollment, student aid, costs, and outcomes, and field of study-level data that provides insights on debt at graduation and earnings one year post-graduation. Originally collected to help prospective students make informed choices, the dataset highlights disparities in education related to race, socio-economic status, debt accumulation, and federal funding distribution. Although the data can be cleaned and loaded, its large size may present challenges in analysis.\nData set 2\nAge-by-Race Specific Crime Rates, 1965-1985: [United States] https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-by-race-specific-crime-rates-1965-1985-united-states-b16aa\nIt is not clear in the description how many rows and columns there are in the dataset, but the variables are categorized into 4 subgroups per race and age over a 21 year time frame. The data was collected by the FBI “Uniform Crime Reports: Crime in the United States” and was aggregated. Using this data, we can answer questions that relate age-by-race crime to crime rates over 21 years. We can also take into account current events of the 1960s-1980s to consider if specific age cohorts had more reported crime rates. For example, we can consider the Baby Boom era and relate it to crime rates post WW2. We can also see which types of crimes were most committed by age-race group per period of time and see if this data is reflective of national crime trends. A challenge I foresee is being able to synthesize categorized data like this in the most effective way. A way to combat this is to focus on a specific crime across the 21 year time frame and analyze the relationship between age-by-race subgroups rather than try to understand many different variables of the same category all at once.\nData set 3\nData Police shootings https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/data-police-shootings?resource=download\nThis dataset has 14 columns and 5.4K rows, and contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US.

The dataset is able to be loaded and cleaned but seems to have some entries missing race data on victims, which might be a problem. With this information, we would like to draw insight on how race, gender, and age play into fatal police shooting trends."

    "text": "We are most interested in further understanding the relationship between the frequency of shootings and race, doing an in-depth analysis of racial proportions by area in relation to the number of shootings in the respective space. Considering that we joined our original dataset with one that provides information on gun restrictions by state, we are also looking to dive deeper into our merged data to find relationships between firearm strictness and shooting frequency by state.\nThe main questions we are working to answer through our data analysis are… 1. Do areas with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic/Latino residents see more shootings? 2. Do states with more firearm precautions and restrictions have lower frequencies of shootings?\nAs we move further into our data analysis and display our findings through figures and tables, we are aiming to answer the above questions in a clear and concise manner that speaks to our audience. In addressing these questions, we can convey a comprehensive analysis of both the police shooting dataset as well as our additional one on gun restrictions to give a well-rounded picture of how race, shootings, and gun strictness impact and relate to one another.\nBelow, we present a series of figures created from our analysis, illustrating key insights and patterns related to our research questions and the relationships between race, shootings, and weapon restrictions.\nFigure 1\n Based on the red and blue dots in the plot, mental illness was likely the model’s first predictor. Considering the poor Pseudo R² of 0.224, adding of predictors and interactions may enhance model performance. The team may have examined mental illness and time, geography, or subject characteristics. To find relevant data trends, they probably transformed continuous variables and created new categorical variables.\nThe model demonstrates moderate predictive power with a Pseudo R² of 0.224. The graph shows that forecasts are uncertain, especially when the likelihood is 25-75% (the large gray band around the curve). The overlap between red dots (mental illness) and blue dots (no mental illness) implies that mental illness alone doesn’t strongly predict “Shot and Tasered”. The model can predict, but its accuracy is low and individual predictions are unclear.\nThis analysis has clear limitations because it only uses mental illness as a predictor. To improve the model, more data on incident details, demographics, and regional factors should be included. Adding these factors would make the predictions more accurate and help explain the “Shot and Tasered” outcome more clearly.\nFigure 2\n State population and firearm shooting are shown in the scatterplot. Population was chosen as the major predictor because it directly affects firearm-related killings; populated states inherently have more incidences. Since a greater population increases crime in absolute terms, this relationship should be linear. This relationship is used in the model to measure how population size affects firearm murders across states. This simple study helps understand trends before adding parameters.\nThe model predicted a high positive link between population and firearm-related killings. More gun homicides occurred in states with larger populations and increased gun ownership. Socioeconomic variables and gun laws explained state differences, improving the model. Cross-validation verified the model’s reliability, while confidence intervals indicated predictor effect uncertainty. However, unmeasured factors like cultural variations or local policies may affect the model’s outcomes. The model delivers important insights, but more data could improve its predictions.\nThe analysis is limited by its focus on population and its assumptions about linearity and comparability between states. While the model provides some insights, including more data and additional predictors would make it more accurate and reliable. This would help create a deeper understanding of what drives firearm-related murders in different states.\nFigure 3\n The scatterplot shows the relationship between actual and predicted murders with firearms. Population was chosen as the main predictor because states with larger populations tend to have more firearm-related murders. A linear relationship between population and firearm murders made linear regression the ideal modeling framework.\nThe “Actual vs Predicted” plot shows that most predicted values align closely with the actual data points, as indicated by their proximity to the diagonal red line. This demonstrates that the model effectively captures the relationship between population and firearm murders. However, a few points deviate from the line, suggesting minor prediction errors due to factors not included in the model. While the results are overall reliable, these discrepancies indicate areas where additional predictors could improve the model.\nThe few data points that deviate from the red line in the “Actual vs Predicted” plot highlight areas where the model under- or over-predicts firearm murders. This suggests that the model misses some key factors that contribute to these discrepancies."
